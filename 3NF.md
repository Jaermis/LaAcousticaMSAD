MSAD System Project
Our system’s newly updated Entity Relationship Diagram has attributes added to it. This is the Monthly Table which has month id. There are related tables that is connected to the monthly table which are month year, and the months. Both tables have the attribute month num for the different months per year. Yearly table has also been added with the attributes year and total sales. Daily was connected with the new table "Dates" to avoid transitive dependency with year_id and month_id. With this system it follows the 3NF (3rd Normalization Form) which means there’s no transitive dependency that’s happening as the attributes are in different tables instead of one big table.
